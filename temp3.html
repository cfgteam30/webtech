    browser, Internet Explorer (IE). The release of IE in 1995 marked the beginning 
    of a four-year marketing competition between Netscape and Microsoft. During 
    this time, both companies worked feverously to develop their own extensions to 
    HTML in an attempt to gain market advantage. Naturally, this competition led 
    to incompatible versions of HTML, both between the two developers and also 
    between older and newer releases from the same company. These differences 
    made it a serious challenge to Web content providers to design single HTML 
    documents that could be viewed by the different browsers.
    In late 1994, Tim Berners-Lee, who developed the initial version of HTML, 
    started the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), whose primary purpose was 
    to develop and distribute standards for Web technologies, starting with HTML. 
    The first HTML standard, HTML 2.0, was released in late 1995. It was followed by HTML 3.2 in early 1997. Up to that point, W3C was trying to catch 
    up with the browser makers, and HTML 3.2 was really just a reflection of the 
    then-current features that had been developed by Netscape and Microsoft. Fortunately, since 1998 the evolution of HTML has been dominated by W3C, in part 
    because Netscape gradually withdrew from its browser competition with Microsoft. There are now several different organizations that produce and distribute 
    browsers, all of which except Microsoft, at least until recently, followed relatively 
    closely the HTML standards produced by W3C. The HTML 4.0 specification 
    was published in late 1997. The 4.01 version of HTML, which


    Write an XHTML document that must contain the statement “Java is an object oriented language”, which continuously moves back and forth across the top of the display. 

    Develop an XHTML document that has textboxes for apple (30 Rs each),orange(15 Rs each), banana(5 Rs each), along with a submit button. These textboxes should take a number, which is the purchased number of the particular fruit. Each of the textboxes should have its own event handler when the value is changed. An event handler for the submit button must produce an alert window with the message “Your total cost is Rsxxx”, where xxx is the total cost of the chosen fruit, 5% sales tax. This handler 
    must return false (to avoid actual submission of the form data). 
    
    ii)Add reality checks to the textboxes of the above mentioned document(Refer i).The checks on the textbox inputs should ensure that the input values are numbers in the range of 0-60
